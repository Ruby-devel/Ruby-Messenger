Ruby Command Line Messenger

This project aims to develop a reliable, fast, and secure command-line messenger using Ruby.
While it may not be the most user-friendly messenger for everyone,
the primary goal is to create a robust and efficient tool,
especially for those who appreciate command line interfaces.

This is my first serious ruby project and is a personal endeavor to enhance my Ruby programming skills.

    Requirements:
        Ruby
        SQLite
        OpenSSL

    Getting Started:
        Clone the repository.
        Install required gems using bundle install.
        Run the server: ruby RDserver.rb.
        Connect to the server using the client: ruby RDclient.rb.

    Commands:
        help: Display available commands.
        list: List all users.
        search: Search for a user.
        add friend: Add a user as a friend.
        friends: List your friends.
        switch room: Switch chat room.
        exit: Leave the chat.

Contribution

This project is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome! 
Feel free to suggest improvements, report issues, or contribute code to enhance the messenger.

Disclaimer
This messenger may not provide the same level of comfort as graphical messengers,
but it serves as a unique project focused on command-line enthusiasts and those seeking to strengthen their Ruby skills.
Happy messaging in the command line!
